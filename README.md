Research Project: Advanced spectro-bathymetric mapping of shallow seafloor using UAV imagery and deep learning techniques (ACTYS)
Funding source: Synergy Grants, Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH)
Duration: 2020 - 2022

The main objectives of this research are to combine UAV spectral data with depth observations from an autonomous surface platform and to develop novel deep learning methods for predicting bathymetry and substratum type of shallow seafloor from multispectral UAV imagery. In order to achieve these goals, the proposed research is planned to be implemented by the participation of IMS/FORTH and ICS/FORTH Institutes in this proposal, each of them providing unique input and support to the proposed activities. This collaboration aims at producing modern, valuable tools in seafloor mapping that will help minimize the costs for field survey and provide an improved view of the coastal seafloor surface.
